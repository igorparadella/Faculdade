240930 13:36:20 [ERROR] Table .\universigym\alimento has no primary key in InnoDB data dictionary, but has one in MySQL! If you created the table with a MySQL version < 3.23.54 and did not define a primary key, but defined a unique key with all non-NULL columns, then MySQL internally treats that key as the primary key. You can fix this error by dump + DROP + CREATE + reimport of the table.

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

key_buffer_size=8388608
read_buffer_size=131072
max_used_connections=1
max_threads=151
thread_count=1
connection_count=1
It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 337866 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
